The source code included in the .zip archive 'UMod.Exporter Source Code' is intended to be used as an example so you can create your own editor windows and tools for your custom mod tools package. 
You may modify and distribute the source code for use in your mod tools package either in the form of uncompiled C# source code or as a pre-compile managed assembly. 
As a minimum you will want to change the namespaces used throughout the code to avoid multiple defined type errors when including the source code into the current project as a pre-compiled UMod Exporter assembly is included which was compiled from the same source.
